I am Liang Kuang from the department of CSE (2021 Turing Class), SUSTech. You can find my CV [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). I am currently applying for CS graduate programs. During high school and undergraduate studies, I participated in algorithm competitions (OI and ACM-ICPC). In this blog, I will share some of the learning materials from my undergraduate years, as well as interesting projects or ideas. Feel free to contact me via email.
