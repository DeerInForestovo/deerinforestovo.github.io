_08/27/2025 Updated_

I’m Liang Kuang, also known as DeerInForest/林空鹿饮溪 on some social platforms.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), graduating with honors from the 2021 Turing Class. I’m now pursuing a master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

I’m actively looking for **SDE internships for summer 2026** and **full-time opportunities starting in 2027**.

Outside of academics, I enjoy connecting with people from around the world and making new friends!
